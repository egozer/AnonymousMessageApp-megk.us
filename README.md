# Firebase-Based Messaging System with User Authentication

#BY THE WAY BEFORE START YOU CAN PREVIEW THIS PROJECT FROM [https://megkus-admin.web.app](https://megkus-admin.web.app)

This project is a simple messaging system built with Firebase, where users can log in with a username and PIN to view their messages. Users can send messages without logging in, but only logged-in users can view their own messages. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users log in with a username and a 4-digit PIN.
- **Personalized Messages**: Messages are only visible to the logged-in user.
- **Anonymous Messaging**: Users can send messages without logging in.
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase Realtime Database for message storage and authentication.
